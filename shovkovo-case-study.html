                    <p>Shovkovo, a Ukrainian brand specializing in 100% silk accessories, built a loyal customer base on
                        Instagram. However, the absence of a dedicated website limited product discoverability and
                        complicated the purchasing process.</p>
                    <p> I designed and developed an elegant, user-friendly e-commerce platform to enhance navigation,
                        streamline transactions, and reflect the brand’s commitment to quality and self-care. This
                        project combined thoughtful UX strategy, intuitive design, and custom WordPress development to
                        elevate the online shopping experience.</p>

                    <h5>Overview</h5>
                    <p>Shovkovo is a Ukrainian brand specializing in 100% silk accessories for sleeping and self-care.
                        Founded as a tribute to a beloved mother, the brand caters to women aged 18–50 who prioritize
                        comfort and self-care. </p>
                    <p>My goal was to design and develop a dedicated website that enhances user experience, streamlines
                        the purchasing process, and increases lead conversion rates.</p>
                    <h5>My Role</h5>
                    <p>I was responsible for UX research, wireframing, prototyping, and implementing the website using
                        the WordPress platform with custom CSS enhancements.</p>
                    <h5>Timeline</h5>
                    <p>Over the course of 20 weeks, the project included:</p>
                    <p>Research & Planning: User interviews, competitive analysis, and defining site structure.
                    <p>Design Phase: Creating wireframes, UI concepts, and interactive prototypes.</p>
                    <p>Development: Implementing designs in WordPress, coding custom elements, and ensuring
                        responsiveness.</p>
                    <p>Testing & Iteration: User testing, stakeholder reviews, and refining the final product.</p>

                <h3>Challenge Statement</h3>
                <p>Shovkovo primarily relied on Instagram for product sales. While this approach fostered a loyal
                    customer base, it posed several limitations, including a lack of streamlined sales processes,
                    limited product discoverability, and inefficient navigation.</p>
                <p>How might we design Shovkovo’s website from scratch to create a seamless, luxurious, and engaging
                    online shopping experience that enhances usability, improves conversion rates, and effectively
                    showcases its premium silk accessories?</p>
                <p>The solution needed to establish a strong brand identity, introduce clear product categorization, and
                    provide a smooth purchasing journey that reflected Shovkovo’s dedication to quality and self-care.

                <div>
                    <p>Shovkovo primarily relied on Instagram for product sales. While this approach fostered a loyal
                        customer base, it posed several limitations:</p>
                    <h5>Lack of streamlined sales process</h5>
                    <p>Instagram was not an optimal platform for browsing and purchasing.</p>
                    <h5>Limited product discoverability:</h5>
                    <p>Users struggled to find detailed product information.</p>
                    <h5>Inefficient navigation:</h5>
                    <p>The absence of categorization made it challenging to explore product options.</p>
                    <p>To address these issues, the brand required a dedicated website that aligned with its aesthetics
                        while improving usability and sales conversion.</p>

                <p>Taking into account the client's existing brand identity, including the recognizable logo, motto, and
                    overall aesthetic, I carefully considered all their requirements and the user's navigation
                    challenges. With this in mind, I proceeded to create mockups specifically tailored to address these
                    pain points effectively.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Taking into account the client’s brand identity and user pain points, I developed a design that
                        prioritized usability and aesthetics:</p>

                    <p>Enhanced Homepage: Featuring a prominent carousel showcasing best-selling products and
                        promotions.</p>

                    <p>Streamlined Catalog Section: Displaying three popular items with essential details for quick
                        browsing.</p>

                    <p>Brand Story Integration: An "About Us" section to connect users with the brand’s story and
                        values.</p>

                    <p>Improved Navigation: Categorized product listings for an intuitive shopping experience.</p>

                    <p>Refined Product Page: Clear customization options (color, quantity) and structured product
                        details (description, care, and specifications).</p>

                    <p>After presenting the high-fidelity prototype, the client requested a dark mode version. To
                        enhance readability and reduce eye strain, I used #121212 for black and #EEEEEE for white,
                        ensuring a soft contrast.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <p>Once the design was approved, I proceeded with development using WordPress and the Flatsome
                        (WooCommerce) theme. Custom CSS refinements ensured alignment with the original design vision.
                        The implementation phase included:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Performance testing across devices and browsers.

                        <li>Plugin integrations for CRM and payment systems.</li>

                <h5>Building Brand Identity Online</h5>
                <p>Transitioning Shovkovo from Instagram sales to a dedicated e-commerce platform reinforced brand
                    trust, improved product discoverability, and created a seamless shopping experience.</p>
                <h5>User-Centered Design for Better Conversions</h5>
                <p>Addressing navigation pain points, enhancing product categorization, and refining the checkout flow
                    led to a more intuitive user experience and improved conversion rates.</p>
                <h5>Balancing Aesthetics & Functionality</h5>
                <p>Combining elegant UI design with practical UX enhancements, including dark mode, resulted in a
                    visually appealing yet highly functional shopping platform.</p>
