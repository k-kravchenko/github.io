            <div>
                <h5>Overview</h5>
                <p>Redesigning the Ukrainian Psychological Hub’s website was a meaningful project aimed at improving access to mental and physical health services. The existing website had usability issues, outdated visuals, and lacked an intuitive structure.</p>
                <p>My role was to enhance the user experience, create a visually appealing interface, and develop new tools to showcase services effectively. I worked closely with stakeholders to define project goals and ensure the redesign aligned with the hub’s mission.</p>
                <h5>My Role</h5>
                <p>As the lead UX/UI designer and web developer, I was responsible for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conducting user research and competitive analysis.</li>
                    <li>Redesigning the website’s structure to improve navigation.</li>
                    <li>Creating high-fidelity UI prototypes in Figma.</li>
                    <li>Developing the site using Wix and custom JavaScript for interactivity.</li>
                    <li>Testing and refining the experience based on feedback.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Timeline</h5>
                <p>Over the course of 16 weeks, the project included:</p>
                <p>Research & Planning: User interviews, competitive analysis, and defining site structure.</p>
                <p>Design Phase: Creating wireframes, UI concepts, and interactive prototypes.</p>
                <p>Development: Implementing designs in Wix, coding custom elements, and ensuring responsiveness.</p>
                <p>Testing & Iteration: User testing, stakeholder reviews, and refining the final product.</p>

                <h3>Challenge Statement</h3>
                <p>The Ukrainian Psychological Hub (UPH) was launched in 2022 as a volunteer initiative to provide mental health support to Ukrainians affected by the full-scale invasion. While it successfully established itself as a vital resource, its website was hastily built to meet urgent needs, prioritizing basic functionality over a well-designed user experience. Now, as UPH expands its services and moves toward a more sustainable model, the current website’s limitations, such as inconsistent navigation, lack of scalability, and an outdated visual identity, hinder its ability to grow and engage users effectively.</p>
                <p>How might we redesign the Ukrainian Psychological Hub’s website to create a seamless, accessible, and visually cohesive experience that enhances usability, reduces bounce rates, and effectively showcases its expanding mental and physical health services?</p>
                <p>The solution must improve navigation, introduce clear calls-to-action, and optimize the specialists' page with better categorization and filtering.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="problem">
                <div>
                    <h3>Understanding the problem</h3>
                </div>
                <div>
                <h5>Current State</h5>
                <p>The Ukrainian Psychological Hub’s (UPH) website has an outdated visual design that fails to attract users or clearly represent the full range of services offered. A cluttered interface and overwhelming colour scheme make it difficult for visitors to quickly find relevant information, leading to a high bounce rate and reduced engagement.</p>
                <h5>Changing Business Needs</h5>
                <p>As of 2024, UPH has expanded its services to include physical health consultations. This shift requires clearer visual cues on specialist profile pages to help users easily identify and contact the appropriate professionals.</p>
                <h5>What Is Working?</h5>
                <p>The website’s navigation is functional, allowing users to move between different pages with ease.</p>
                <h5>What Is Not Working?</h5>
                <p>The visual design does not effectively communicate UPH’s services, and the hero section lacks a compelling call-to-action (CTA). Additionally, the specialists' page is inconsistent, poorly categorized, and does not highlight the new physical health services effectively.</p>
                <h5>What should be developed?</h5>
                <p>A new feature for psychological support groups should be introduced, and the specialists' page should include filters for easier and more effective searching.</p>

            <div>
                <p>To gain insight into user experiences, pain points, and valued features, I conducted interviews with both clients and psychologists. Three key takeaways emerged:

                    Cluttered Home Page: Clients find the homepage overwhelming and difficult to navigate, making it harder to access essential information.
                    
                    Ineffective Specialist Listings: Clients struggle to compare psychologists due to an overly long list with insufficient details in each profile, making the selection process frustrating.
                    
                    Visibility Concerns: Psychologists feel that those positioned lower on the list receive fewer client inquiries, reducing their chances of being chosen.</p>

            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Mindly and Rozmova are the main players in the market and serve as the primary competitors for the Ukrainian Psychological Hub. By analyzing their strengths and weaknesses, I identified key opportunities for improvement:</p>

                <p> Modern Design & Organization Matter – both platforms prioritize clean and modern visual design, making information easier to digest. A well-structured landing page, as seen on Rozmova, improves usability and helps guide users efficiently.</p>
                    
                <p>Accessibility of Specialist Listings – Mindly offers a comprehensive list of specialists, but access is restricted to a mobile app, limiting convenience for users who prefer desktop browsing. Rozmova, on the other hand, simplifies the selection process but restricts clients to a limited number of suggested specialists.</p>
                    
                <p>Balancing Choice & Guidance – Mindly provides an extensive list, but the lack of direct website access makes it less user-friendly. Rozmova narrows choices through a questionnaire, but this limits user autonomy. An ideal solution should offer both structured guidance and open browsing to accommodate different user preferences.</p>
                    
                <p>Since Mindly and Rozmova set the industry standard, the Ukrainian Psychological Hub has an opportunity to differentiate itself by combining strong visual appeal with improved accessibility, comprehensive filtering, and a more flexible user experience.</p>

                <p>The client maintains their website on the Wix platform. To start, I thoroughly explored the platform’s tools and capabilities. To ensure a recognizable brand identity, I decided to retain the yellow and blue from the logo but use them only as accent colours. I structured the landing page into clear, distinct sections and applied the colour block technique to enhance navigation and improve the overall user experience.</p>

                <p>For the hero section I created a collage which supposed to mean a balance between different parts of people’s life. Also, I equipped it with a prominent CTA-button.</p>

                    <p>The “Therapeutic groups” section is one a new service established by the organization. Considering the amount of groups and information they contain, I decided to create an accordion. Switching between groups’ names users can see a picture featured to the group with short description. By pressing twice, users are able to go to the group. For implementation this element I used a WIX tab element and Java Script written for switching pictures.</p>
                    
                    <p>The “Announcements and Events” section already existed on the website. To make it more distinctive and modern, I designed a new neumorphic style and applied it to the Wix element by adding custom CSS configurations for shadows.</p>
                    
                    <p>I redesigned the Specialists Page by dividing it into two visually distinct sections based on the type of services offered. The first section features psychologists, while the second highlights specialists in physical health. To ensure quicker access to the second section, I added a yellow-highlighted advertisement box that directs users there. Additionally, I implemented categories to streamline the process of selecting a specialist.</p>
                    
                    <p>Additionally, I redesigned the About Us and Specialist’s Profile pages. For the Specialist’s Profile page, I created a new CRM system and connected it to the other pages.</p>

                <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            </div>
                <h5>The Importance of a Hero Section</h5>
                <p>A well-crafted hero section is essential for several reasons: it sets the tone for your website, communicates your brand’s identity, and highlights your value proposition. Initially, I had a different concept for the main visual design. However, after presenting it to the client, we agreed to explore various styles for the hero section. Once we selected a particular design, I needed to adjust the entire design concept to ensure alignment.</p>
                <h5>Communication is Key</h5>
                <p>Effective communication with the client, including scheduling regular Zoom calls to discuss project issues and tasks, is crucial. By maintaining open and frequent dialogue, we successfully avoided major challenges and kept the project on track.</p>
                <h5>Scope Creep is Real</h5>
                <p>Observing visual improvements on the website can lead to a desire to add more deliverables. Therefore, it’s essential to define the project scope clearly and take notes without getting distracted, ensuring that the project stays on schedule.</p>
